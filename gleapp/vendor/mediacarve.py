"""mediacarve: recover images, video, audio and databases from any stream of bytes, by signature.

One file, pure Python, standard library only. No compiler, no network, and
nothing to install. It scans a seekable stream for media file signatures and
reports each one it finds as an extent: where it starts, how long it is, and
what kind of file it is.

    import mediacarve

    with open("disk.raw", "rb") as fh:
        for hit in mediacarve.carve(fh):
            print(hit.kind, hit.offset, hit.length, hit.bounded)

The input is any object with ``seek`` and ``read``, so this works on a raw
image, a disk, a file inside an archive, or an E01 opened with ewfprobe. It
never writes to the stream it reads.

Two consumers, two shapes, one core. A tool that keeps its own index wants the
extents and will fetch the bytes on demand. A tool that wants files on disk can
hand the extents to ``extract`` or use the command line, which writes a folder
or a zip. Both come out of the same scan.

**What "bounded" means.** Some formats record their own length, so the extent is
exact. Some do not, and the end is found by parsing to the terminator. Some give
neither, and the extent is a capped guess. Each hit says which it was, because
the difference matters to whoever reads the output:

    header    the file's own header or box structure gave the length
    parsed    the length came from walking the file's internal structure
    capped    the extent was cut at a limit (the ceiling for its kind, the end
              of the stream, or the end of a clipped range), so the length is
              a ceiling and not a fact

**What this does not do.** It finds files that are contiguous. A fragmented file
recovers only as far as its first fragment. It reads no filesystem, so it has no
filenames, paths or timestamps to offer, and it cannot say whether a hit was a
live file, a deleted one, or a fragment of something else. Those are the reasons
carving complements a filesystem parser rather than replacing it.

    one IDAT; and IEND's data field is empty (11.2.4). Apple's iOS build tools
    write a CgBI chunk ahead of IHDR, so that one is allowed first too.

    Critical chunks (an uppercase first letter, section 5.4) have their CRC

    TIFF has no length field. The file is an 8-byte header naming the first
    IFD, and IFDs of a 2-byte entry count, 12-byte entries and the offset of the
    next IFD; an entry's value sits in the entry when it fits in 4 bytes and is
    pointed to otherwise, and "this file offset may point anywhere in the file,
    even after the image data" (TIFF 6.0, section 2). So the walk follows every
    IFD, in the chain and through the tags that point to more of them, and the
    end is the furthest of: each IFD, each value it points to, and each strip,
    tile and JPEG stream with its byte count.

    Taken only as the specification draws it: at least one entry in every IFD,
    entries in ascending tag order, every type one it sizes, and an image, that
    is strips or tiles, in some IFD, so the TIFF inside a JPEG's or a HEIC's Exif
    data, which has no image of its own, is not a file. BigTIFF (header 43) is
    not read.

    Nothing in a TIFF says where it ends, so an end taken from pointers is only
    as good as the pointers: 2 of the files below are GeoTIFFs under 1 KB whose
    tile table points 4 MB past the end of the file, and laid among other files
    such an end would hide every one it covers. So a TIFF hides what follows it
    only when every strip and tile opens the way its compression says it must
    (_tiff_data_starts_right); otherwise its offset goes into ``loose`` and it
    hides nothing.

    Measured on 323 distinct TIFFs from public phone images: 268 come out at exactly
    their size; 51 end 1 to 4 bytes early, the missing bytes all zeros, padding
    after the last structure; 2 are the GeoTIFFs above; 2 are BigTIFF. 240 are
    LZW or Deflate and every strip opens right; 81 are uncompressed.

    ISO 32000-1 (PDF 32000-1:2008): the header is "%PDF-1.N" on its own line
    (7.5.2); the last line of the file is %%EOF, and the two before it are
    startxref and the byte offset of the last cross-reference section, counted
    from the start of the file (7.5.5), which may be a cross-reference stream
    object (7.5.8). An incremental update appends objects, a cross-reference
    section and a trailer with its own %%EOF (7.5.6). A linearized file has an
    earlier first-page trailer whose startxref may be a dummy 0, to be ignored
    (Annex F.3.4). So a %%EOF counts only if its startxref, counted from this
    header, lands on a cross-reference section; after one, the scan carries on
    only if what follows is more of the file, an object or an xref section, as
    in an update, comment lines allowed before it. The end is that %%EOF and
    the line break after it. A file that ends in %%EOF with no line break, when
    the next byte happens to be a carriage return or line feed, comes back one
    byte long: nothing tells the two apart.

    Measured on 1,294 PDFs from public phone images: every header is followed
    by a line break, 135 have two %%EOF markers, and in every one the last
    %%EOF points back to a cross-reference section and, with its line break,
    ends the file. 310 end in %%EOF with no line break.

    stream that starts after those have ended is chained, and RFC 3533 requires
    a group to stand on its own once unchained, so the file is taken to end
    there and the next group is reported separately.

    Not every writer sets the end-of-stream flag: 9 of the 27 distinct Ogg Opus
    files in one public Android 13 image (hickman_a13) end on a clean page
    boundary with every CRC good and no such page. So a page that fails its CRC,
    breaks its stream's page sequence, or is not a page at all ends the file at
    the last page that checked, rather than rejecting it. Every byte reported
    has passed a CRC as part of this file; a file that was damaged or overwritten
    part way comes back as the part before the damage.

    A page cut off by the end of the stream returns the length the page declares,
    which carve() then cuts to the stream and reports as capped. The first page
    is never taken on trust: it has to be whole and pass its CRC, or nothing is
    reported.

    The codec is only known once the walk is done, so the walk runs to the larger
