"""Case creation / opening and the ingest-source specification.

A *case* is a directory containing:
    case.gleapp        SQLite database
    thumbs/           generated thumbnails and video key frames
    case.json         (optional) the source specification used to build it
    reports/          exported reports

Ingest sources
--------------
`add_sources` accepts either:
  * a filesystem path (folder or single file), or
  * a path to a JSON file describing one or more folders.

Accepted JSON shapes (all keys case-insensitive)::

    {"folder": "C:/evidence/usb1"}
    {"folders": ["C:/evidence/usb1", "C:/evidence/usb2"]}
    {
      "case": "Operation Example",
      "examiner": "H. Charpentier",
      "sources": [
        {"name": "USB-1", "path": "C:/evidence/usb1", "max_mb": 500},
        {"name": "Phone",  "path": "C:/evidence/android/DCIM",
         "include_other": false, "follow_symlinks": false},
        {"name": "Handset", "path": "C:/evidence/EXTRACTION_FFS.zip", "stage": true}
      ]
    }

A path that is a zip is an archive source. Its media is read from the zip on demand
unless ``stage`` is true, which copies it under the case instead (see ``archive``).

The member images of a RAID set are one source: ``"members": [...]`` in a job file
lists them, with ``path`` (or the first member) read first. ``image_set_source``
builds one from paths given any other way.
