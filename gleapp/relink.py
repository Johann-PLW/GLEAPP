"""Relink a folder source: point the case at a folder of evidence that has moved.

A folder ingest and a Project VIC import record each file's full path on the
examiner's machine, so moving that folder leaves the case unable to open any
full-size file or put one in an export, while thumbnails, hashes and categories,
which live in the case, still work. Archive and disk-image sources have their own
relink in ``archive.relink_source``; this covers every other source.

A new folder is accepted only when it holds every file of the source, at the same
path relative to the source's folder, with the same size and the same MD5 the case
recorded. One missing or different file refuses the whole relink and the case is
left as it was.
